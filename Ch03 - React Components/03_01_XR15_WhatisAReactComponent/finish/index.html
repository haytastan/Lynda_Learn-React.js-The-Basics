<!-- this method of transforming is no longer supported in new react libraries!
we are trying to transform jsx to js before run time to get faster. 
we first placed the helloworld component into helloworld.js in src folder. next we installed node.js to use npm.
then we got into this finish directory on command line. after we ran the command npm install -g react-tools. 
now that react-tools is installed we do our transformation and create a js file inside build folder by typing jsx src/ build/
lastly we add a link to the new file on this index.html and removed the older ones-->
